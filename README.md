# ArduinoEyebrowCommuncation

This is a device designed to help sombone to comunicate with their eyebrow. 
It was built for somone with ALS who can currently only move his eyebrow and this is how he communicates.
Evrey time the hall sensor comes near to a magnet(meaning he raises his eybrow) the led lights up (or the a buzzer can ring).
The potentionmeter is attached so that one can eailsy change the sensitivty of the sensor.
This project can easily be done with the attached code and the diagram attached.

I plan on expanding it to more formal communication such as a Yes and No aswell as using the device as a computer mouse.
Look out for update.
